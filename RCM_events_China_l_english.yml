 rcmchina.1.t:0 "Japan Demands a Fully Independent Chahar-Hebei Political Council"
 rcmchina.1.d:0 "Japanese soldiers recently sent a request demanding our government to recognize the independence of Chahar-Hebei Political Council. No doubt this is an attempt to divide China and forcing us to surrender more territory - just like the Mukden Incident when the Japanese invaded Manchuria. \n\nHow should we respond?"
 rcmchina.1.a:0 "We can't let them steal our lands without a war."
 rcmchina.1.b:0 "We need to focus on crushing the Communists."
 rcmchina.2.t:0 "Germany Withdraws Advisors"
 rcmchina.2.d:0 "Germany has caved in to Japanese diplomatic pressure, and decided to withdraw their military advisors from our country! Von Falkenhausen promised at a farewell dinner that he would not reveal any of our battle plans to the Japanese, but the end of German support is sure to hurt our military."
 rcmchina.2.a:0 "We will have to make do without them."
 rcmchina.3.t:0 "Poor Sino - German Relations"
 rcmchina.3.d:0 "Our deteriorating relationship with Germany has resulted in them recalling all of their military advisors from our country."
 rcmchina.3.a:0 "Chinese officers will finish what they started!"
 rcmchina.4.t:0 "Military Advisors Detained"
 rcmchina.4.d:0 "As we are now in a state of war with Germany, all of their military advisors that were present in our country have been detained. Von Falkenhausen and a few of his cronies managed to elude our grasp, and have returned to Europe!"
 rcmchina.4.a:0 "Good riddance!"
 rcmchina.5.t:0 "Cornered No More"
 rcmchina.5.d:0 "The Red Army once survived in a state of what seemed like hopelessness, but since the Long March several years back, the tide has slowly turned. With significant territorial advances, our role as an underdog is a thing of the past. Having fought through this time of struggle, our desperation is now behind us. Mao Zedong has gone from guerrilla army leader to chairman."
 rcmchina.5.a:0 "Long live the People's Republic!"
 rcmchina.6.t:0 "Preparing Attack Against Communists"
 rcmchina.6.d:0 "After the long retreat of the Communist Party of China's Red Army, they have managed to regroup and establish themselves in Shaanxi. Their continued effort to turn the rural population against us and seek support from the Soviet Union suggest that they might grow more powerful if left to their own devices. However, many of the surrounding warlords, despite supporting our government, are unwilling or unable to make the necessary sacrifices for an effective attack.\n\nIt's currently unclear whether the Red Army is still recuperating or ready to face us in battle, but time is not on our side. To strengthen our political position, we need to strike against the communists."
 rcmchina.6.a:0 "Strongarm local warlords into the offensive."
 rcmchina.6.b:0 "Recruit local outlaws to fight for us."
 rcmchina.6.c:0 "Rely on local volunteers who oppose the communists."
 rcmchina.7.t:0 "Kuomintang Launch Offensive"
 rcmchina.7.d:0 "Although we have escaped certain defeat through the Long March, the nationalists are not planning to let us grow stronger without more confrontations. Our spies suggest they are mounting an offensive against us, which could weaken our political support if we try to retreat further.\n\nWe don't know how committed the Kuomintang are to pushing us back right now. Trying to confront them carries significant risks. If the local warlords have been rallied to support the attack, our chances may be slim. On the other hand, retreating now when we have finally stopped may not be an option."
 rcmchina.7.a:0 "Confront the attack with whatever means we can afford!"
 rcmchina.7.b:0 "Retreat into isolation."
 rcmchina.8.t:0 "Communists Retreat"
 rcmchina.8.d:0 "Discovering our planned offensive through their local spy network, the CPC have withdrawn their Red Army further into Shaanxi. Although this deprived us of the opportunity to further weaken their numbers, this has shown that the communists are not ready to confront us, despite what their propaganda says. To some extent, the effort has still worked to our benefit."
 rcmchina.8.a:0 "Cowards!"
 rcmchina.9.t:0 "Victory Against Communists"
 rcmchina.9.d:0 "Our commitment to routing the Red Army has been successful, at least for now. Despite gaining information about the attack, the communists decided to confront our forces and lost. They have now been forced to withdraw further and many of the locals have grown skeptical of their ability to deliver on their promises of overthrowing our government."
 rcmchina.9.a:0 "And rightly so!"
 rcmchina.10.t:0 "Communists Repel Attack"
 rcmchina.10.d:0 "Having gained information about our plans to launch an offensive beforehand, the Red Army was prepared and confronted our attack. The troops we had managed to assemble in this area, where our power base is weak, were insufficient to defeat the communist forces. \nSadly, the attack has been turned against us and seen as a sign of the Red Army's recovery after their long retreat."
 rcmchina.10.a:0 "It won't help them in the long run."
 rcmchina.11.t:0 "Defeat Against the Kuomintang"
 rcmchina.11.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to repel the attack of locally assembled troops supporting the nationalist government, our preparations were insufficient to stop it. With significant losses, we have been forced into a new retreat, albeit shorter.\n\nConfronting the nationalists before we had fully recovered may have been a mistake. Our magnificent recovery in the Long March instilled hope in our supporters, but now, seeds of doubt have been sown."
 rcmchina.11.a:0 "We will recover and win the faith of the people again."
 rcmchina.12.t:0 "Victory Against the Kuomintang"
 rcmchina.12.d:0 "Challenging the Kuomintang offensive has worked in our favor. The locally assembled troops sent to confront the Red Army were not prepared for our knowledge of the impending attack and were defeated, all serving as a warning to nearby warlords that attacking us can be costly. \n\nThe nationalists have only proven that they underestimate us as a foe, and that the People's Republic is once again on the rise."
 rcmchina.12.a:0 "Political Power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
 rcmchina.13.t:0 "Clash with Communist Guerrillas"
 rcmchina.13.d:0 "With both us and the Chinese Red Army barely having recovered from our previous offensive, our mutual troop presence close to the border has reignited the conflict. In addition to the local warlords and militias, we have considered moving in more troops from elsewhere.\n\nAlthough this may not give us opportunity to crush the communist menace once and for all, it would be an important ideological victory to show that they will not be allowed to expand further."
 rcmchina.13.a:0 "We must draw the line now!"
 rcmchina.13.b:0 "We can't afford another confrontation."
 rcmchina.14.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
 rcmchina.14.d:0 "Despite our efforts to push show that the communists will not be allowed to expand their influence outside of where they have currently taken refuge, we could not afford to commit enough resources to win the conflict along the [From.GetName] border.\n\nThe sporadic conflicts with communist militias slowly turned out more and more in their favor, which in the end made the campaign a failure in demonstrating that we have the situation under control. If their popular support keeps increasing, the communists could turn out to be a genuine threat."
 rcmchina.14.a:0 "Troubling."
 rcmchina.15.t:0 "Victory in [From.From.GetName]"
 rcmchina.15.d:0 "After a number of smaller encounters in the outskirts of our controlled territory, the conflict with the Kuomintang appears to have turned to our advantage. Although maintaining constant pressure has been taxing on our troops and supplies, the effort has been worthwhile. \n\nNo decisive battles have been fought, we have won a slow victory this time, which has strengthened the faith in our cause and fanned the flames of the revolution once again."
 rcmchina.15.a:0 "This will not be soon forgotten!"
 rcmchina.16.t:0 "Defeat in [From.GetName]"
 rcmchina.16.d:0 "Our efforts to wage an indirect war against the increased Kuomintang presence has proven disastrous. The nationalists were simply more dedicated to pushing us back than we thought, perhaps expecting the impact this failure would have on our reputation. Although our army is once again safe to recover, for now, the losses have not gone unnoticed by the locals, and rumors of the failure of the revolution are already spreading to nearby villages."
 rcmchina.16.a:0 "The revolution is far from dead!"
 rcmchina.17.t:0 "Victory in [From.From.GetName]"
 rcmchina.17.d:0 "Our efforts to draw the line against the threat of communism have been successful. The CPCs guerrilla campaigns in response to our increased troop presence in regions surrounding their power base failed to anticipate our dedication to stopping them. This show of strength, although not entirely without costs, has convinced many of the locals who previously gave their tacit support to [From.GetLeader] and his party have now begun to realize that China can never be united under such an ideology."
 rcmchina.17.a:0 "Let us hope they remember."
 rcmchina.18.t:0 "Clash with Nationalist Army"
 rcmchina.18.d:0 "While we have still barely recovered from their previous offensive, the nationalists appear to be increasing their troop presence in the areas close to our border. Clearly, they are trying to show that they once again have us contained and that the Great March only delayed their final strike against the CPC. We cannot let the people think this is true."
 rcmchina.18.a:0 "We cannot afford to spend our time recovering."
 rcmchina.100.t:0 "China Comes Under Further Attack"
 rcmchina.100.d:0 "Like a cat Japan advances and took Korea. They sought to humiliate us with their twenty-one demands, they occupy Manchuria and now they advance again. Well, no more, China will fight to her last to be free. In a speech to the people, [Root.GetLeader] appealed to all [Root.GetAdjective], that they stand together or face certain doom alone."
 rcmchina.100.a:0 "For China!"
 rcmchina.101.t:0 "China Is Under Attack"
 rcmchina.101.d:0 "After the Marco Polo Incident, the National Government of the Republic of China has declared that our country, China, is in a state of emergency. It is time we stand together against our common foe, the Japanese. Let us lay aside petty squabbles and fight as a strong, united China!"
 rcmchina.101.a:0 "Fight for China!"

 rcmchina.101.c:0 "United we are strong!"
 rcmchina.101.e:0 "We will stay out of this."

 rcmchina.101.g:0 "Fight for the United Front!"
 rcmchina.102.t:0 "China Is Under Attack"
 rcmchina.102.d:0 "With the Soviet Union occupied with the war against Germany we have been advised that they will no longer be able to provide the same amount of protection as they have done in the past. It will be in our best interests to gain the support of the KMT and join them in their war against Japan."
 rcmchina.102.a:0 "United we are strong!"
 rcmchina.102.b:0 "Let us fight back the Japanese menace together."
 rcmchina.102.c:0 "Our interests are best protected by the mighty Soviet."
 rcmchina.103.t:0 "[From.GetName] Joins our Government"
 rcmchina.103.d:0 "[From.GetName] has chosen to join the our government in the fight against the Japanese. This can help a great deal in our war effort. Divided we can't do a thing, united we will drive the invaders back!"
 rcmchina.103.a:0 "United we are strong!"
 rcmchina.104.t:0 "China Is Under Attack"
 rcmchina.104.d:0 "China is under attack. The warlords are putting aside their grievances to fight against the invading Japanese forces. This is an opportunity to advance the interests of the CPC, we can show the people of China that it is us and not the decadent KMT who are the true future for China. Should we join the fight as well and ensure that there is a future for China?"
 rcmchina.104.a:0 "United we are strong!"

 rcmchina.108.t:0 "Communism Advances"

More and more people are seeing that we are the future for China, especially in comparison to the corrupt Kuomintang.

 rcmchina.112.d:0 "The war between the Japanese Imperial government and Chiang's nationalist government fully broke out yesterday. Warlords and Cliques are all joining the Chinese United Front. Though joining their coalition is not taken into consideration, we should still at least declare war on Japan. We can deal with the Nationalist after the war."

Dai's motivation was claimed to be revenge against Chiang for his recent` fall from grace.\n\nDai's summary trial and execution lead to rumours about him just being a scapegoat for the real culprit, who most believe to be Wang."
