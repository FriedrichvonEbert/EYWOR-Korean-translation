It is recommended for casual players to play on Civilian/Recruit difficulty for the first couple times to get used to the mod. Do not attempt Elite Difficulty or buff the enemies on first try, as it can be a hindrance for you to learn the mod.\n\nAside from that, following these tips can help you enjoy the mod more:\n    1. Go over starting national spirits: Go over the starting national spirits and help you understand what to do to either avoid certain bad things from happening or do things that can get rid of the debuffs.\n    2. Check decisions often: Sometimes there are things you are supposed to be doing described in decisions. Check the decision tab often can ensure that you don't miss out on some important things to do.\n    3. Read tooltips: Tooltips in this mod, especially the ones with specially color highlights, usually provide you with useful information."

And due to the fact that its long-term victory will be mostly dependent on the Nationalists, there are several things to keep in mind for an enjoyable experience:\n    1. Do NOT buff Japan: The game has been carefully balanced so that Nationalist AI can fend off Japan on its own until the US entry into the war. Buffing Japan will disrupt the balance greatly and is very likely to create a game that's impossible to win.\n    2. "Contact Zhang Xueliang" ASAP: The "Contact Zhang Xueliang" National focus allows you to create a tacit truce with the Northeastern Army (represented as a DMZ in the game), which can ensure that the Nationalists won't attack you directly."
