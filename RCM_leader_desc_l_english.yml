POLITICS_CHIANG_KAI-SHEK_DESC:0 "The Generalissimo is certainly a powerful man with his grasp on the KMT and affairs in the Republic of China. By participating in the Xinhai Revolution he quickly grew in prominince with the Chinese Republican movement ultimately becoming Sun's disciple. After Dr. Sun's death Chiang took advantage of the power struggle between Liao, Hu and Wang and deposed Wang Jingwei during the Canton coup starting a rivalry between the two. After seizing power he led the KMT on the Northern Expedition where his attack on the CPC showed his anti-communist stance. After uniting the nation under the KMT the Generalissimo gave China an era of economic stability and industrial development."
