 INS_destroyer_1:0 "Van Ghent Class"
 INS_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Van Ghent, or Admiralen, class consisted of eight destroyers built for the Royal Dutch Navy between 1926 and 1931. The ships were based upon early versions of the British A-class. All ships fought in World War II and were either scuttled or sunk. The ships displaced over 1,300 tons, were armed with four 120mm guns, and had decent speed for their vintage."
 INS_destroyer_3:0 "Callenburgh Class"
 INS_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Gerard Callenburgh class planned for four destroyers for the Royal Dutch Navy. All four were launched before the German invasion, but only two were completed, one by the British after escaping to England, and one by the Germans. These destroyers displaced over 1,600 tons, were armed with five 120mm guns in their main armament, as well as eight 533mm torpedo tubes, and had good speed."
 INS_destroyer_4:0 "Piet Hein Class"
 INS_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Piet Hein class consisted of three British S-class destroyers transferred to the Royal Dutch Navy shortly after the war. The ships displaced over 1,800 tons, were armed with four 120mm/45 QF Mk IX guns, and had a wide array of ASW armaments."
 INS_light_cruiser_1:0 "Java Class"

 INS_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The De Zeven Provinciën class consisted of two cruisers laid down just before the German invasion but not completed until 1951. The final design was modified from the original 1939 plan, and led to two ships that displaced over 12,000 tons and were armed with eight Bofors 152mm cannon. They were well-armored for a light cruiser and had good range."
 INS_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Soerabaja Class"
