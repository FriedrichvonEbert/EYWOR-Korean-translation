 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite several invasions from the Japanese and the loss of Manchuria, the Repulic of China is experiencing an unprecedented increase in national stability ever since the Northern Expedition. \n\nHowever, the Japanese military has been more and more aggressive in recent years and refuse to retreat from Manchuria even after receiving worldwide condemnations from the League of Nations. Many expect that peace won't last much longer."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The second Sino-Japanese War is tearing the Repulic apart. Many soldiers and civilians are murdered and trampled upon by the savages from Japan. Multiple fake regimes has been created to fasten their grips on the occupied territories. \n\nSome fearmongers claim that the odds are against our side, and they might be right -- but the brave chinese men and women will make the tables turn."
 MON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Maintaining a solid military relationship with the Soviet Union, Mongolia seems like a place of political stability in comparison with its southern neighbors. However, the growing military influence of Japan in Manchuria and the turmoil happening in Inner-Mongolia still constitutes a major threat to the Mongolian People. The power struggle within the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party isn't helping, either. Something gotta give."
 MON_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After much bloodshed and purging with the MPRP, Khorloogiin Choibalsan, a staunch ally of Joseph Stalin and sometimes even referred to as “the Stalin of Mongolia”, came into power as the Prime Minister of Mongolia. However, this only seems to make purging of political dissidents and buddhist practictioners worse. There's also the Japanese threat in the East, which could stir up some serious trouble if handled poorly. Is there still hope for Mongolia?"
 SIK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sheng Shicai came to power through a bloody coup, Ma Clique warlord's aggression and local factional rebellions were suppressed with the support of the Soviet Union, temporarily stabilizing his regime. However, this stability was merely backed by a foreign power. In order to sieze power, Sheng joined the Communist Party of Soviet Union. However, the Turks and other local popualation are not happy with that, waiting for a chance to topple Sheng's Dictactorship."

 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the "Long March" succeeded in transferring the remaining forces to northern Shaanxi, the situation of the Chinese Communist Party is still not looking so well, surrounded by warlords and nationalists alike. The Nationalist government of China is preparing an attack on them, and the Japanese imperialists are also slowly marching towards them. The fire of the Chinese revolution is shaky. Can the Chinese Communist Party find their silver lining in this situation?"

 FIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Conquered during the second half of the 19th century, Indochina is France's richest and most populous colony, ecompassing the protectorates of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and the concession of Kouang-Tchéou Wan. During the Great War, it sent crucial manpower in the factories and the battlefields.\n\nSince then, however, independentist movements have been growing stronger, culminating in the failed Yen Bai Mutiny in 1930. Now, the situation seems to have stabilized, but for how long?"
 FIC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Indochina, the pearl of the French Empire, finds itself in a very precarious position. Threatened by the Japanese expansionism, and far from the Métropole, its defence is probably a lost cause in case of war. Despite the recent reforms, the independentist movements are still strong, and are now backed by Japan.\n\nFrance has recently sent a strong signal by naming Georges Catroux as governor-general, but will it be enough to protect the Empire? "
 SIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "暹羅王朝在過去靠著卓越的外交技巧維持了獨立性，並且步入了現代化的進程，但是在1930年代初期受到大蕭條衝擊而改制為君主立憲制，在隨後的軍事政變中成為由軍人治理的國家。現在，暹羅的民族主義正在高漲，而她有好幾條道路可以選，該繼續建設內部或是收復歷史領土?或是回歸帝王統治?日本帝國的影響力也是不容忽視的存在。"
 SIA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "暹羅正在國家命運的抉擇上，在過去幾年的民族主義高漲下，領導人將國家名稱改為泰國，並且與日本建立了友好的外交關係，然而日本是個可靠的選擇嗎?還是選擇大英帝國這個老牌的大帝國比較合乎未來的利益?或者是著手建立一個由泰國所主導的外交體系呢?"
 GXC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "新桂系與蔣介石的國民政府在過去不斷的交鋒，但軍事上卻無法擊敗他們，他們有著完善的內部動員體系以及強大的意志，但是他們缺少現代化的裝備。而日本帝國正不斷侵蝕中國的領土，且國民政府正在加緊建軍的現在，桂系是該揚起抗日的大旗?還是謀求自身的出路?"
 SHX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "閻錫山曾經在中原大戰中領導眾多勢力與國民政府交鋒，但遭到挫敗，現在僅剩小範圍的治理區域，並且受到三方的威脅，北邊有著日本帝國與其傀儡國滿州國，西方有著剛戰略轉移完的共產黨，南邊則有國民政府，閻錫山的晉系能在壓力當中找出自己的未來嗎?"
 HPC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "冀察政務委員會成立於1935年，成員有各式各樣的意識形態與目的，是中國政府阻饒日本帝國華北分離運動所成立的地方政權，因此她有著國民政府無法深入干涉的龐大自主權。來自日本的壓力正在逐間增加當中，宋哲元能否帶領這個勢力對抗日本呢?還是會由其他成員帶向其他方向?"
 XSM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "西北軍閥由馬家軍所統治，但內部鬥爭不斷，30年代初期曾經有成員被逐出後進逼新疆但不幸慘敗，現在他們正與國民政府有著較為友善的關係，只要不深入破壞他們的統治，馬家軍將不會反抗他們的上層，但相反的，只要有任何干擾因子進入西北地區，那他們將會團結起來一致對外。"
 YUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "雲南曾經為強大的地方勢力，但在唐繼堯時期消耗殆盡，在他被龍雲取代後，龍雲便開始展開長年的雲南治理作業。現在雲南雖然只是個小勢力，但是只要中國受到強大外敵的入侵，雲南人將會拿起他們老舊的武器，踏步前往戰場的最前方。"
 GUD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "陳濟棠在廣東所建立的粵系在中國版圖當中佔有一席之地，北面是強大的國民政府，西面是李宗仁領導的新桂系，如今要靠自身力量與南京抗衡是非常困難的，或許，李宗仁是個很好的交涉對象，能夠聯手對抗任何外敵，或是繼續待在廣東這個熟悉地區，但無論如何，所有的抉擇都是具有危險性的，得慎重選擇。"
 SIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "四分五裂的四川軍閥經歷過兩劉之戰後，四川軍閥趨於一統，劉湘成為四川省主席，劉文輝被派往西康，但四川如今正受到南京方面的影響，是否該考慮主動釋出善意?或者是繼續試圖保持四川的自主性?日本帝國的威脅也逐日增加當中，若戰爭開打，拿起武器的四川人絕對不會落於人後，而在西康的劉文輝是否能重返四川、還是另尋出路呢?"
 SHD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "韓復榘投靠國民政府後，便取得了山東的治理權，但韓復榘並不是想安穩地待在他人之下，他逐出了國民政府的軍隊與政要，並在山東建立了自己的軍隊，建立了自己的山東勢力，雖仍依附於國民政府，但隨時都能拋棄國民政府統治，加入他想要聯手的對象。"

 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."

 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made during it would help India gain her independence, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by any means necessary."

 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed an alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."

 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories populated not only by Romanians. To guard against the revanchist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government has allowed these alliances to lapse.\n\nAs the situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone and vulnerable."

 NETHERLANDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Dutch government eyes the mounting global tensions with concern. Between an ailing economy, a powerful pacifist movement, and a firm belief in neutrality to the point of driving potential allies away, they are unable to properly prepare their defenses.\n\nAt the same time, the importance of the Netherlands as a gateway of trade into the continent means that both the British and the Germans desire Dutch 'cooperation' to thwart the other, and may take rejection as a reason for hostility."

For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."
