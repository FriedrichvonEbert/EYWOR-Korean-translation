 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Two Suns in the Sky"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Tension has been building up in the Far East. In the Empire of Japan, Prime Minister Okada is struggling to maintain his rule due to the rising influence of the military. Even within the military, interservice rivaly is commonplace and a rising faction within the Army, the Imperial Way Faction, or the Kodoha, is causing nationwide unrest. Many officers within the Japanese military are advocating expansionism in one form or another. In the Republic of China, despite the completion of the Northen Expedition, the communists guerillas and the remaining warlords are still dividing the country. Chiang Kai-Shek, the leader of the Republic of China, believes that China must be pacified within before dealing with foreign threat, however, many figureheads within China disagrees, pointing out that defending against Japan's aggression is more important. The Future of Far East remains uncertain, but the Rising Sun and the Blue Sky and White Sun are certainly scorching the land of Far East with the raising tension between the two powers."
 
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "War of Resistance"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Marco Polo Bridge Incident of 1937 has caused an all out war between the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China, putting the Far East into the flames of warfare and carnage once again. Despite Germany's attempt to mediate between the two conflicting powers at the early stage of the war, the Empire of Japan is uninterested in such intervention and responded by upholding this conflict as a "Holy War." The Republic of China, on the other hand, has yet to complete its encirclement campaign against the communists before the outbreak of the war and Chiang was forced to reach a truce with them during the Xi'an Incident of 1936, forcing him to focus on preparing against Japanese aggression. Unfortunately for China, such event did not stop the Japanese expansion and China has suffered tremendous casualties after the Battle of Shanghai, which took place a month after the initial incident. To China, the outcome of this conflict would be a matter of life and death. To survive as a nation, the War of Resistance will have to be won one way or another."
 EHB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the Japanese advances into Chinese territories, some people have either lost all faith for the Central Government, or figured that working with the Japanese would be a more viable option. Either way, these people managed to negotiate with Japanese and created new alternative governments backed by them. Perhaps to some, what they are doing is high treason and unforgivable acts, but to them, it's either them or the Corrupted Central Government."
 ECA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1933, Li Shouxin's forces in Inner Mongolia clashed with the Imperial Japanese Army on the border with Manchukuo, and Li managed to down a Japanese aircraft. However, this opened the door to negotiations, and in exchange for weapons, money and supplies, Li defected to the Japanese side.\n\nIn late 1935 he commanded Manchukuo forces aiding the Japanese in seizing control of the eastern part of Chahar and became in charge of the region, which is now called the "East Chahar Autonomous Region.""
 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords will have a lot of challenges to overcome in order to hold onto their regional dominance."
 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:1 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side, but there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
