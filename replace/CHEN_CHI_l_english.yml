 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery, and in the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Qing Emperor and will try to divide the nation even further.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and unite China ultimately."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."

 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce, both sides are well aware that this United Front cannot last.\n\nThe Communist base area now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese. The Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive and expand, because the confrontation against Japan may cause large number of casualties, but also a potential chance to diminish the armed forces of Chiang Kai-shek and take advantage from the Nationalists by escalating border frictions..."
