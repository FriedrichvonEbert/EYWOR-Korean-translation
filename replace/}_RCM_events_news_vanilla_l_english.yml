nuke_dropped.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]A nuclear bomb, originally intended for Kokura, was detonated today over the Nagasaki. Weather conditions forced the planes to divert their mission, a combination of smoke, clouds and technical difficulties being deciding factors in an event that may well change history.\n\nThe effects of the bomb were contained somewhat by the city's location in a valley, but the damage is still severe. Some military installations were struck, but the catastrophic civilian losses overshadow them by far. It may take decades before we know the long-term effects of this weapon with certainty."
nuke_dropped.3.a:0 "Will this lead to [From.From.Owner.GetAdjective] surrender?"
nuke_dropped.3.b:0 "We had hoped Nagasaki would be spared."
nuke_dropped.4.t:0 "Atomic Bombing of Berlin"
nuke_dropped.4.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]Today, at [GetDateText], the German capital of Berlin was struck by a nuclear explosion. The city has suffered several attacks, in this war and the last, but all else pale in comparison to this. Not since the Thirty Years' War has Berlin seen comparable devastation - considering its growth, this was seen as an impossibility.\n\nThe Führerbunker appears to have survived the blast at least partially due to the bomb detonating away from its planned epicenter, and [From.From.Owner.GetLeader] is rumored to still be alive, if outraged. How [From.From.Owner.GetAdjective] leaders should be evacuated and if they can be protected from the fallout is another matter, however."
nuke_dropped.4.a:0 "Today, I am relieved not to be a Berliner."
nuke_dropped.4.b:0 "Our enemies have struck at the heart of the nation!"

nuke_dropped.5.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]A nuclear explosion has devastated the city of London today. Despite the city's anti-air defenses, [From.From.Owner.GetNameDef] was not prepared for this attack. At [GetDateText], Big Ben chimed for the last time, having been melted by the blast. Early reports suggest Buckingham Palace has been completely leveled and the whereabouts of the royal family are currently unknown.\n\n[From.From.Owner.GetLeader] has nevertheless been confirmed to have survived and is preparing a rousing speech for the radio later today. With morale at an all-time low, the British people is in dire need of this - or a very eloquent surrender."
nuke_dropped.5.a:0 "It's difficult to maintain a stiff upper lip in the face of a nuclear blast wave."
nuke_dropped.5.b:0 "God save the King!"
nuke_dropped.6.t:0 "Atomic Bombing of Kyoto"
nuke_dropped.6.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]The city of Kyoto, a prominent [From.From.Owner.GetAdjective] industrial center, was struck today by a nuclear bomb. It is speculated that the city was chosen as a target because it has been regarded as an intellectual center.\n\nThe beauty and historical significance of the Kyoto led many to assume it would be spared from the bomb, but it appears the terror of raining destruction on such a place has rather been seen as a benefit, increasing the psychological impact of the attack. The city's location in the valley somewhat limited the blast, but the old Imperial Palace and many industrial buildings have been completely destroyed."
nuke_dropped.6.a:0 "Legacy and beauty mean nothing in a war like this."
nuke_dropped.6.b:0 "If they destroy the old, we will build the new."
nuke_dropped.7.t:0 "Atomic Bombing of Tokyo"
nuke_dropped.7.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]Today, a nuclear strike was directed at the heart of the Japanese Empire. The capital of Tokyo, although expected to be the target of firebombing, was never assumed to be a prioritized target of this new weapon. Yet ultimately, perhaps due to the significance of the new capital and Imperial Palace which has now been destroyed, an even more all-consuming fire has fallen on the city.\n\nAlthough [From.From.Owner.GetLeader] is reported to have survived, the event has raised questions about how far Japan's enemies are willing to go. If the war does not end with this, what targets remain? What is left to threaten with?"
nuke_dropped.7.a:0 "Does this mean the end of the Japanese Empire?"
nuke_dropped.7.b:0 "As long as [From.From.Owner.GetLeader] lives, so does the Empire."

nuke_dropped.8.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]A nuclear bomb was detonated today over the capital of the United States. In an attack clearly directed at the political center and historical legacy of the US, the White House, the Capitol and a number of monuments and memorials were wiped off the face of the Earth. Even the Burning of Washington over a century ago pales in comparison to the destruction visited upon the city by this devastating weapon.\n\nAlthough President [From.From.Owner.GetLeader] has been brought to safety, the nation has been shaken to its core. No doubt, the US hoped to be the first and only country to wield such a weapon. Those hopes have now been shattered in the worst possible way."

nuke_dropped.9.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]A nuclear explosion struck the city of Rome today, shocking people around the world. Due to its historical and artistic treasures, many had never thought the ancient city would be the target of such indiscriminate destruction. With the Vatican City also partially destroyed and the whereabouts of the Pope unknown, the event has horrified not only Italians, but Catholics around the world.\n\nRome's rapid growth in the past decade has been nearly completely undone by the attack. For a while, it looked like the city could aid the nation's recovery after the war was over. Those hopes have now been turned to dust, along with many people."

nuke_dropped.10.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]Today, a nuclear device was detonated over the city of Paris, causing widespread destruction and countless casualties. France was in shock as its capital suffered what may be the most devastating attack it ever experienced, despite centuries of wars and revolutions. The Parisians had perhaps expected conquest, but not utter, brutal desolation.\n\nAny victory parades at Champs-Élysées past the remains of the Arc de Triomphe seem unlikely in the city's current state. Perhaps the coming decades will see the birth of a new Paris, but Paris in the public mind, the city built in the Belle Époque, is gone forever."
nuke_dropped.10.a:0 "The city of light has burned out."

nuke_dropped.11.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]A city many have tried and failed to conquer, Moscow was the target of a nuclear attack today. The explosion was directed at the heart of [From.From.Owner.GetAdjective] leadership, the Kremlin having been nearly completely destroyed by the blast.\n\n[From.From.Owner.GetLeader], having grown more aware and fearful of all possible and impossible threats recently, evacuated in time and survived. However, even the vastness of [From.From.Owner.GetName] may not be enough to escape such a ruthless enemy. Indeed, if this continues, the nation will soon consist only of two kinds of wastelands: Those which were there in the first place, and those created by its enemies."
nuke_dropped.11.a:0 "Won't a nuclear winter only make Moscow a more difficult target?"
nuke_dropped.11.b:0 "They may burn every city we have, but they will never take them."
nuke_dropped.12.t:0 "Atomic Bombing of Copenhagen"
nuke_dropped.12.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]Today, the city of Copenhagen was struck by a nuclear explosion. Having grown after escaping destruction in the Great War thanks to Denmark's neutrality, the capital has never experienced an attack close to this devastating since the Napoleonic Wars. The surrounding area of Öresund has also seen significant fallout and survivors have begun escaping to Fyn and the mainland in fear of further attacks.\n\nKing Christian X's whereabouts are currently unknown, and the nation's morale has been severely damaged by the attack. It remains to be seen if this is the beginning of the end for one of Europe's oldest nations."
nuke_dropped.12.a:0 "Something is irradiated in the state of Denmark."
nuke_dropped.12.b:0 "The city has burned before, but not perished."

nuke_dropped.13.d:0 "[This.GetNewsIcon]The beautiful city of Stockholm, proud Venice of the North, was struck by a nuclear bomb today. Despite their best efforts to stay neutral in the past, the Swedes have now paid the ultimate price for international conflict. The epicenter of the blast was in the middle of south central Stockholm, an area intended for future development and grand construction projects, now irreversibly destroyed.\n\nMuch of the city is beyond recognition, but the old structures at Slussen seem to have survived the blast better than expected. It has been decided that it should stand untouched forever as a monument to the city's resilience."
nuke_dropped.13.a:0 "With this, Swedish neutrality will be but a memory."
