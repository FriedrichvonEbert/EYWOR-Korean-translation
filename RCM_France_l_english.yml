 rcmfrance.1.d:0 "The Popular Front, composed of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), the Radical-Socialists, the French Communist Party (PCF), and miscellaneous leftists, won power from the broad Republican coalitions that had governed since the 6 February 1934 crisis in the recent election.
